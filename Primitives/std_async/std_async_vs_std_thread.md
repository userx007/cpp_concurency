Let's dive into both `std::async` and `std::thread` with simple and complex examples.

### Simple Example

#### Using `std::thread`
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>

void printMessage() {
    std::cout << "Hello from thread!" << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    std::thread t(printMessage);
    t.join(); // Wait for the thread to finish
    return 0;
}
```
In this example, `std::thread` is used to run the `printMessage` function in a separate thread. The `join` method ensures the main thread waits for the new thread to complete.

#### Using `std::async`
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <future>

int main() {
    auto future = std::async( {
        std::cout << "Hello from async!" << std::endl;
    });
    future.get(); // Wait for the async task to finish
    return 0;
}
```
Here, `std::async` runs a lambda function asynchronously. The `get` method waits for the asynchronous task to complete.

### Complex Example

#### Using `std::thread`
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <vector>

void computeSum(int start, int end, int& result) {
    result = 0;
    for (int i = start; i <= end; ++i) {
        result += i;
    }
}

int main() {
    int result1, result2;
    std::thread t1(computeSum, 1, 50, std::ref(result1));
    std::thread t2(computeSum, 51, 100, std::ref(result2));

    t1.join();
    t2.join();

    int totalSum = result1 + result2;
    std::cout << "Total sum: " << totalSum << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
In this complex example, two threads are used to compute the sum of numbers in different ranges. The results are combined after both threads complete.

#### Using `std::async`
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <future>
#include <vector>

int computeSum(int start, int end) {
    int result = 0;
    for (int i = start; i <= end; ++i) {
        result += i;
    }
    return result;
}

int main() {
    auto future1 = std::async(computeSum, 1, 50);
    auto future2 = std::async(computeSum, 51, 100);

    int totalSum = future1.get() + future2.get();
    std::cout << "Total sum: " << totalSum << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
Here, `std::async` is used to run the `computeSum` function asynchronously for different ranges. The results are retrieved using `get` and combined.

### Key Differences
- **`std::thread`**: Requires manual management of thread lifecycle (e.g., `join`).
- **`std::async`**: Automatically manages the asynchronous task and provides a future object to retrieve the result.

The performance differences between `std::async` and `std::thread` can vary based on several factors, including the implementation details, the nature of the tasks, and the system's hardware. Here are some key points to consider:

### `std::async`
1. **Thread Pooling**: Some implementations of `std::async` use a thread pool internally, which can reduce the overhead of creating and destroying threads repeatedly [1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67034861/why-would-concurrency-using-stdasync-be-faster-than-using-stdthread). This can lead to better performance for tasks that are frequently executed.
2. **Automatic Management**: `std::async` automatically manages the lifecycle of the asynchronous task, which can simplify code and reduce the chances of errors related to thread management [2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25814365/when-to-use-stdasync-vs-stdthreads).
3. **Deferred Execution**: `std::async` can defer execution until the result is needed, potentially optimizing resource usage [3](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2016/the-promises-and-challenges-of-stdasync-task-based-parallelism-in-c11/).

### `std::thread`
1. **Manual Control**: `std::thread` provides more control over thread creation and management, which can be beneficial for complex threading scenarios [2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25814365/when-to-use-stdasync-vs-stdthreads).
2. **Overhead**: Creating and destroying threads manually can introduce overhead, especially for short-lived tasks [1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67034861/why-would-concurrency-using-stdasync-be-faster-than-using-stdthread).
3. **Flexibility**: `std::thread` allows for more flexible and fine-grained control over concurrency, which can be advantageous in certain situations[2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25814365/when-to-use-stdasync-vs-stdthreads).

### Practical Considerations
- **Task Duration**: For long-running tasks, both `std::async` and `std::thread` can perform similarly. However, for short-lived tasks, `std::async` might have an edge due to potential thread pooling[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67034861/why-would-concurrency-using-stdasync-be-faster-than-using-stdthread).
- **Complexity**: `std::async` is generally easier to use for simple asynchronous tasks, while `std::thread` might be preferred for more complex concurrency control [2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25814365/when-to-use-stdasync-vs-stdthreads).

### Example Benchmark
A benchmark comparing `std::async` and `std::thread` for tiny tasks showed that `std::async` can be faster due to lower overhead in managing threads [1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67034861/why-would-concurrency-using-stdasync-be-faster-than-using-stdthread). However, the performance difference can vary based on the specific use case and system configuration.


Let's create a simple benchmark to compare the performance of `std::async` and `std::thread` for a computational task. We'll measure the time taken to compute the sum of a range of numbers using both methods.

### Benchmark Example

#### Using `std::thread`
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <vector>
#include <chrono>

void computeSum(int start, int end, int& result) {
    result = 0;
    for (int i = start; i <= end; ++i) {
        result += i;
    }
}

int main() {
    int result1, result2;
    auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();

    std::thread t1(computeSum, 1, 50000000, std::ref(result1));
    std::thread t2(computeSum, 50000001, 100000000, std::ref(result2));

    t1.join();
    t2.join();

    auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
    std::chrono::duration<double> duration = end - start;

    int totalSum = result1 + result2;
    std::cout << "Total sum: " << totalSum << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Time taken (std::thread): " << duration.count() << " seconds" << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

#### Using `std::async`
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <future>
#include <chrono>

int computeSum(int start, int end) {
    int result = 0;
    for (int i = start; i <= end; ++i) {
        result += i;
    }
    return result;
}

int main() {
    auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();

    auto future1 = std::async(std::launch::async, computeSum, 1, 50000000);
    auto future2 = std::async(std::launch::async, computeSum, 50000001, 100000000);

    int totalSum = future1.get() + future2.get();

    auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
    std::chrono::duration<double> duration = end - start;

    std::cout << "Total sum: " << totalSum << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Time taken (std::async): " << duration.count() << " seconds" << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
- **Task**: Both examples compute the sum of numbers from 1 to 100,000,000, split into two ranges.
- **Timing**: We use `std::chrono::high_resolution_clock` to measure the time taken for each method.
- **Output**: The total sum and the time taken are printed.

### Running the Benchmark
Compile and run both programs to compare the time taken by `std::thread` and `std::async`. You might observe that `std::async` can be faster due to potential optimizations like thread pooling [1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26730287/c11-thread-vs-async-performance-vs2013) [2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25814365/when-to-use-stdasync-vs-stdthreads).
