`std::async` is a powerful feature in C++11 and later that allows you to run a function asynchronously (i.e., in a separate thread) and obtain its result via a `std::future` object. This is particularly useful for parallel programming and concurrent execution.

### Key Concepts of `std::async`

1. **Asynchronous Execution**:
   - `std::async` runs a function asynchronously, meaning the function runs in a separate thread, allowing the main thread to continue executing without waiting for the function to complete.

2. **Return Value**:
   - The return value of the asynchronous function is captured in a `std::future` object. You can use this `std::future` to retrieve the result once the function has completed.

3. **Launch Policies**:
   - `std::async` accepts a launch policy that determines how the function is executed. The two main policies are:
     - `std::launch::async`: Forces the function to run in a new thread.
     - `std::launch::deferred`: The function is not run until the result is explicitly requested (lazy evaluation).

### Basic Usage

Here's a simple example to illustrate the usage of `std::async`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <future>
#include <thread>

// Function to be run asynchronously
int compute(int x) {
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(2)); // Simulate a long computation
    return x * x;
}

int main() {
    // Launch the function asynchronously
    std::future<int> result = std::async(std::launch::async, compute, 5);

    // Do other work while the function runs
    std::cout << "Doing other work...\n";

    // Get the result of the asynchronous function
    int value = result.get(); // This will block until the function completes

    std::cout << "Result: " << value << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Launching the Function**:
   - `std::async(std::launch::async, compute, 5)` launches the `compute` function asynchronously with the argument `5`. The `std::launch::async` policy ensures that the function runs in a new thread.

2. **Future Object**:
   - The `std::future<int> result` object is used to store the result of the `compute` function. The type of the `std::future` matches the return type of the function.

3. **Doing Other Work**:
   - While the `compute` function runs in the background, the main thread can continue executing other code.

4. **Getting the Result**:
   - `result.get()` is used to retrieve the result of the `compute` function. This call will block (i.e., wait) until the function has completed and the result is available.

### Launch Policies

- **`std::launch::async`**:
  - Forces the function to run in a new thread immediately.
  - Example: `std::async(std::launch::async, compute, 5);`

- **`std::launch::deferred`**:
  - The function is not run until the result is explicitly requested via `get()` or `wait()`.
  - Example: `std::async(std::launch::deferred, compute, 5);`

### Error Handling

`std::future` can also handle exceptions thrown by the asynchronous function. If the function throws an exception, calling `get()` on the `std::future` will rethrow the exception.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <future>
#include <stdexcept>

int risky_compute(int x) {
    if (x < 0) throw std::runtime_error("Negative input not allowed");
    return x * x;
}

int main() {
    std::future<int> result = std::async(std::launch::async, risky_compute, -5);

    try {
        int value = result.get();
        std::cout << "Result: " << value << std::endl;
    } catch (const std::exception& e) {
        std::cerr << "Error: " << e.what() << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, if `risky_compute` throws an exception, the `get()` call will catch and handle it.

Great questions! Let's break down the differences between `std::async` and `std::thread`, and then I'll show you how to use `std::async` with lambda functions.

### Differences Between `std::async` and `std::thread`

1. **Ease of Use**:
   - **`std::async`**: Automatically handles the creation and management of threads, making it easier to use for simple parallel tasks.
   - **`std::thread`**: Requires manual management of threads, including joining or detaching them.

2. **Return Values**:
   - **`std::async`**: Returns a `std::future` object that can be used to retrieve the result of the asynchronous function.
   - **`std::thread`**: Does not directly support returning values. You need to use additional synchronization mechanisms like `std::promise` and `std::future` to achieve this.

3. **Exception Handling**:
   - **`std::async`**: Propagates exceptions from the asynchronous function to the caller via the `std::future` object.
   - **`std::thread`**: Exceptions must be handled within the thread function or communicated back to the main thread using other mechanisms.

4. **Launch Policies**:
   - **`std::async`**: Supports launch policies (`std::launch::async` and `std::launch::deferred`) to control when and how the function is executed.
   - **`std::thread`**: Always creates a new thread immediately.

5. **Synchronization**:
   - **`std::async`**: Automatically synchronizes the completion of the asynchronous function when `get()` or `wait()` is called on the `std::future`.
   - **`std::thread`**: Requires explicit synchronization using `join()` or `detach()`.

### Using `std::async` with Lambda Functions

Yes, you can use `std::async` with lambda functions! Here's an example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <future>

int main() {
    // Lambda function to compute the square of a number
    auto compute_square =  {
        return x * x;
    };

    // Launch the lambda function asynchronously
    std::future<int> result = std::async(std::launch::async, compute_square, 5);

    // Do other work while the lambda function runs
    std::cout << "Doing other work...\n";

    // Get the result of the lambda function
    int value = result.get(); // This will block until the function completes

    std::cout << "Result: " << value << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In this example:
- **Lambda Function**: The lambda function `compute_square` takes an integer and returns its square.
- **Asynchronous Execution**: `std::async` is used to run the lambda function asynchronously with the argument `5`.
- **Result Retrieval**: The result is retrieved using `result.get()`, which blocks until the lambda function completes.

Would you like to explore more advanced topics or specific use cases related to `std::async` or `std::thread`?

Combining `std::async` with `std::future` is a powerful way to manage asynchronous tasks and retrieve their results. Here's a detailed example that demonstrates how to use `std::async` with `std::future` to perform parallel computations and combine their results.

### Example: Parallel Computation of Array Sum

Let's extend the previous example to compute the sum of an array using multiple asynchronous tasks and combine their results using `std::future`.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <future>

// Function to compute the sum of elements in a range
int parallel_sum(const std::vector<int>& arr, int start, int end) {
    // Base case: if the range is small, compute directly
    if (end - start < 1000) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = start; i < end; ++i) {
            sum += arr[i];
        }
        return sum;
    }

    // Recursive case: split the range and compute in parallel
    int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
    auto left_future = std::async(std::launch::async, parallel_sum, std::ref(arr), start, mid);
    auto right_future = std::async(std::launch::async, parallel_sum, std::ref(arr), mid, end);

    // Join: wait for both halves to complete and combine results
    return left_future.get() + right_future.get();
}

int main() {
    // Create a large array of integers
    std::vector<int> arr(10000, 1); // Array of 10000 elements, all initialized to 1

    // Compute the sum using parallel computation
    int total_sum = parallel_sum(arr, 0, arr.size());

    std::cout << "Total sum: " << total_sum << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Function Definition**:
   - The `parallel_sum` function computes the sum of elements in a specified range of the array. If the range is small, it computes the sum directly. Otherwise, it splits the range into two halves and computes the sum of each half asynchronously using `std::async`.

2. **Using `std::async`**:
   - `std::async(std::launch::async, parallel_sum, std::ref(arr), start, mid)` launches the `parallel_sum` function asynchronously for the first half of the array.
   - `std::async(std::launch::async, parallel_sum, std::ref(arr), mid, end)` launches the `parallel_sum` function asynchronously for the second half of the array.

3. **Combining Results**:
   - The results of the asynchronous tasks are retrieved using `left_future.get()` and `right_future.get()`, which block until the respective tasks complete.
   - The final sum is obtained by adding the results of the two halves.

### Benefits of Combining `std::async` with `std::future`

- **Parallelism**: Efficiently divides tasks into smaller sub-tasks and runs them in parallel, improving performance for large computations.
- **Simplicity**: Simplifies the management of asynchronous tasks and their results without needing explicit thread management.
- **Exception Handling**: Propagates exceptions from asynchronous tasks to the main thread, allowing for robust error handling.

### Using Lambda Functions with `std::async` and `std::future`

You can also use lambda functions with `std::async` and `std::future` for more flexible and concise code. Here's an example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <future>

int main() {
    // Create a large array of integers
    std::vector<int> arr(10000, 1); // Array of 10000 elements, all initialized to 1

    // Lambda function to compute the sum of elements in a range
    auto parallel_sum = &arr -> int {
        if (end - start < 1000) {
            int sum = 0;
            for (int i = start; i < end; ++i) {
                sum += arr[i];
            }
            return sum;
        }

        int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
        auto left_future = std::async(std::launch::async, parallel_sum, start, mid);
        auto right_future = std::async(std::launch::async, parallel_sum, mid, end);

        return left_future.get() + right_future.get();
    };

    // Compute the sum using parallel computation
    int total_sum = parallel_sum(0, arr.size());

    std::cout << "Total sum: " << total_sum << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the lambda function `parallel_sum` is used to compute the sum of the array in parallel, demonstrating the flexibility of combining `std::async` with lambda functions.

### Handling Exceptions in `std::async` Tasks

When using `std::async`, exceptions thrown by the asynchronous function are propagated to the `std::future` object. You can handle these exceptions by catching them when you call `get()` on the `std::future`. Here's an example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <future>
#include <stdexcept>

// Function that may throw an exception
int risky_compute(int x) {
    if (x < 0) throw std::runtime_error("Negative input not allowed");
    return x * x;
}

int main() {
    // Launch the function asynchronously
    std::future<int> result = std::async(std::launch::async, risky_compute, -5);

    try {
        // Get the result, which will rethrow the exception if one was thrown
        int value = result.get();
        std::cout << "Result: " << value << std::endl;
    } catch (const std::exception& e) {
        std::cerr << "Error: " << e.what() << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this example:
- The `risky_compute` function throws a `std::runtime_error` if the input is negative.
- The exception is propagated to the `std::future` object.
- When `result.get()` is called, the exception is rethrown and can be caught and handled in the `catch` block.

### Using Shared Resources with `std::async`

When using `std::async` with shared resources, you need to ensure thread safety to avoid data races and undefined behavior. This can be achieved using synchronization mechanisms like `std::mutex` and `std::lock_guard`.

Here's an example that demonstrates how to safely use a shared resource with `std::async`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <future>
#include <mutex>

// Shared resource
std::vector<int> shared_data;
std::mutex data_mutex;

// Function to modify the shared resource
void modify_shared_data(int id) {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(data_mutex); // Lock the mutex
    shared_data.push_back(id);
    std::cout << "Task " << id << " added data.\n";
}

int main() {
    const int numTasks = 10;
    std::vector<std::future<void>> futures;

    // Launch tasks asynchronously
    for (int i = 0; i < numTasks; ++i) {
        futures.push_back(std::async(std::launch::async, modify_shared_data, i));
    }

    // Wait for all tasks to complete
    for (auto& f : futures) {
        f.get();
    }

    // Print the contents of the shared resource
    std::cout << "Shared data: ";
    for (int value : shared_data) {
        std::cout << value << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example:
- **Shared Resource**: `shared_data` is a vector that is accessed by multiple tasks.
- **Mutex**: `data_mutex` is used to synchronize access to the shared resource.
- **Locking**: `std::lock_guard<std::mutex>` is used to lock the mutex when modifying the shared resource, ensuring thread safety.

### Summary

- **Exception Handling**: Use `try-catch` blocks around `future.get()` to handle exceptions thrown by asynchronous tasks.
- **Shared Resources**: Use synchronization mechanisms like `std::mutex` and `std::lock_guard` to safely access and modify shared resources in asynchronous tasks.

Would you like to explore more advanced topics or specific use cases related to `std::async` and concurrency in C++?

Using condition variables with `std::async` tasks can help coordinate the execution of tasks and manage shared resources efficiently. Condition variables are used to block a thread until a particular condition is met, which is useful for synchronizing tasks.

Here's an example that demonstrates how to use condition variables with `std::async`:

### Example: Producer-Consumer Problem

In this example, we'll implement a simple producer-consumer scenario where the producer generates data and the consumer processes it. We'll use `std::async` for asynchronous tasks and `std::condition_variable` to synchronize the producer and consumer.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <future>
#include <mutex>
#include <condition_variable>

// Shared resources
std::queue<int> data_queue;
std::mutex queue_mutex;
std::condition_variable data_cond;

// Producer function
void producer(int count) {
    for (int i = 0; i < count; ++i) {
        std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(100)); // Simulate work
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(queue_mutex);
        data_queue.push(i);
        std::cout << "Produced: " << i << std::endl;
        data_cond.notify_one(); // Notify the consumer
    }
}

// Consumer function
void consumer(int id) {
    while (true) {
        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(queue_mutex);
        data_cond.wait(lock, [] { return !data_queue.empty(); }); // Wait for data

        int data = data_queue.front();
        data_queue.pop();
        lock.unlock();

        std::cout << "Consumer " << id << " processed: " << data << std::endl;

        if (data == -1) break; // Exit condition
    }
}

int main() {
    // Launch producer and consumer asynchronously
    auto producer_future = std::async(std::launch::async, producer, 10);
    auto consumer_future = std::async(std::launch::async, consumer, 1);

    // Wait for the producer to finish
    producer_future.get();

    // Signal the consumer to exit
    {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(queue_mutex);
        data_queue.push(-1); // Special value to signal exit
        data_cond.notify_one();
    }

    // Wait for the consumer to finish
    consumer_future.get();

    return 0;
}
```

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Shared Resources**:
   - `data_queue`: A queue to hold the produced data.
   - `queue_mutex`: A mutex to protect access to the queue.
   - `data_cond`: A condition variable to synchronize the producer and consumer.

2. **Producer Function**:
   - The producer generates data and pushes it into the queue.
   - After adding data to the queue, it notifies the consumer using `data_cond.notify_one()`.

3. **Consumer Function**:
   - The consumer waits for data to be available in the queue using `data_cond.wait()`.
   - Once data is available, it processes the data and removes it from the queue.
   - The consumer exits when it encounters a special value (`-1` in this case).

4. **Main Function**:
   - The producer and consumer functions are launched asynchronously using `std::async`.
   - The main function waits for the producer to finish and then signals the consumer to exit by pushing a special value into the queue and notifying the consumer.

### Key Points

- **Condition Variables**: Used to block the consumer until data is available in the queue.
- **Mutex**: Ensures that access to the shared queue is thread-safe.
- **Notification**: The producer notifies the consumer when new data is available, and the main function notifies the consumer to exit.

This example demonstrates how to use condition variables with `std::async` to synchronize tasks and manage shared resources efficiently. Would you like to explore more advanced synchronization techniques or specific use cases?

C++ offers several synchronization primitives to manage concurrent access to shared resources and ensure thread safety. Here are some of the most commonly used ones:

### 1. **Mutex (`std::mutex`)**
A mutex is used to protect shared data from being simultaneously accessed by multiple threads. It provides exclusive ownership to a thread, ensuring that only one thread can access the protected resource at a time.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <mutex>

std::mutex mtx;

void print_thread_id(int id) {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    std::cout << "Thread " << id << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    std::thread t1(print_thread_id, 1);
    std::thread t2(print_thread_id, 2);

    t1.join();
    t2.join();

    return 0;
}
```

### 2. **Recursive Mutex (`std::recursive_mutex`)**
A recursive mutex allows the same thread to lock the mutex multiple times without causing a deadlock. This is useful in scenarios where a function that holds a lock calls another function that also tries to acquire the same lock.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <mutex>

std::recursive_mutex rec_mtx;

void recursive_function(int count) {
    if (count <= 0) return;
    std::lock_guard<std::recursive_mutex> lock(rec_mtx);
    std::cout << "Count: " << count << std::endl;
    recursive_function(count - 1);
}

int main() {
    std::thread t(recursive_function, 5);
    t.join();
    return 0;
}
```

### 3. **Timed Mutex (`std::timed_mutex`)**
A timed mutex allows a thread to attempt to acquire a lock for a specified duration. If the lock is not acquired within the duration, the thread can take alternative actions.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <mutex>
#include <chrono>

std::timed_mutex timed_mtx;

void try_lock_for_duration() {
    if (timed_mtx.try_lock_for(std::chrono::seconds(1))) {
        std::cout << "Lock acquired\n";
        timed_mtx.unlock();
    } else {
        std::cout << "Failed to acquire lock\n";
    }
}

int main() {
    std::thread t1(try_lock_for_duration);
    std::thread t2(try_lock_for_duration);

    t1.join();
    t2.join();

    return 0;
}
```

### 4. **Shared Mutex (`std::shared_mutex`)**
A shared mutex allows multiple threads to read shared data simultaneously while ensuring exclusive access for writing. This is useful for scenarios where read operations are frequent and write operations are rare.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <shared_mutex>

std::shared_mutex shared_mtx;
int shared_data = 0;

void reader() {
    std::shared_lock<std::shared_mutex> lock(shared_mtx);
    std::cout << "Read data: " << shared_data << std::endl;
}

void writer() {
    std::unique_lock<std::shared_mutex> lock(shared_mtx);
    shared_data++;
    std::cout << "Wrote data: " << shared_data << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    std::thread t1(reader);
    std::thread t2(writer);
    std::thread t3(reader);

    t1.join();
    t2.join();
    t3.join();

    return 0;
}
```

### 5. **Condition Variable (`std::condition_variable`)**
A condition variable is used to block a thread until a specific condition is met. It is typically used in conjunction with a mutex to synchronize access to shared data.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <mutex>
#include <condition_variable>

std::mutex cv_mtx;
std::condition_variable cv;
bool ready = false;

void wait_for_ready() {
    std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(cv_mtx);
    cv.wait(lock, [] { return ready; });
    std::cout << "Thread is ready\n";
}

void set_ready() {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(cv_mtx);
    ready = true;
    cv.notify_one();
}

int main() {
    std::thread t1(wait_for_ready);
    std::thread t2(set_ready);

    t1.join();
    t2.join();

    return 0;
}
```

### 6. **Atomic Operations (`std::atomic`)**
Atomic operations provide a way to perform thread-safe operations on shared data without using locks. They are useful for simple operations like incrementing counters.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <atomic>

std::atomic<int> atomic_counter(0);

void increment_counter() {
    atomic_counter++;
}

int main() {
    std::thread t1(increment_counter);
    std::thread t2(increment_counter);

    t1.join();
    t2.join();

    std::cout << "Counter: " << atomic_counter << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

These synchronization primitives help manage concurrent access to shared resources and ensure thread safety in C++ programs. Would you like to explore any specific primitive in more detail or see more examples?


### Choosing the Right Synchronization Primitive

Choosing the right synchronization primitive depends on the specific requirements of your concurrent programming scenario. Here are some guidelines to help you decide:

1. **Mutex (`std::mutex`)**:
   - **Use Case**: When you need to protect shared data from being accessed by multiple threads simultaneously.
   - **Example**: Protecting a shared counter or a shared data structure.
   - **Considerations**: Simple and effective for mutual exclusion, but can lead to deadlocks if not used carefully.

2. **Recursive Mutex (`std::recursive_mutex`)**:
   - **Use Case**: When the same thread needs to acquire the same mutex multiple times (e.g., in recursive functions).
   - **Example**: Recursive functions that need to lock the same resource.
   - **Considerations**: Slightly more overhead than `std::mutex`.

3. **Timed Mutex (`std::timed_mutex`)**:
   - **Use Case**: When you need to attempt to acquire a lock for a specific duration.
   - **Example**: Trying to acquire a lock with a timeout to avoid indefinite blocking.
   - **Considerations**: Useful for avoiding deadlocks and managing time-sensitive tasks.

4. **Shared Mutex (`std::shared_mutex`)**:
   - **Use Case**: When multiple threads need to read shared data simultaneously, but only one thread should write.
   - **Example**: Read-heavy scenarios with occasional writes, like caching mechanisms.
   - **Considerations**: Allows multiple readers but only one writer, improving performance for read-heavy workloads.

5. **Condition Variable (`std::condition_variable`)**:
   - **Use Case**: When you need to block a thread until a specific condition is met.
   - **Example**: Producer-consumer scenarios where a consumer waits for data to be produced.
   - **Considerations**: Requires careful use with a mutex to avoid spurious wakeups and ensure thread safety.

6. **Atomic Operations (`std::atomic`)**:
   - **Use Case**: For simple atomic operations on shared data without using locks.
   - **Example**: Incrementing a counter or setting a flag.
   - **Considerations**: Provides lock-free thread safety for simple operations, reducing overhead.

7. **Latches and Barriers (`std::latch`, `std::barrier`)**:
   - **Use Case**: For coordinating multiple threads to wait until a certain point is reached.
   - **Example**: Synchronizing phases of a parallel algorithm.
   - **Considerations**: Introduced in C++20, useful for one-time or recurring synchronization points [1](https://isocpp.org/blog/2024/10/synchronization-primitives-in-cpp20-shivam-kunwar) [2](https://www.kdab.com/synchronization-primitives-in-c20/).

### Pitfalls of Using Mutexes

While mutexes are essential for ensuring mutual exclusion, they come with several pitfalls:

1. **Deadlocks**:
   - **Description**: Occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a mutex, resulting in a standstill.
   - **Example**: Thread A locks mutex 1 and waits for mutex 2, while thread B locks mutex 2 and waits for mutex 1.
   - **Avoidance**: Always lock mutexes in a consistent order and use `std::lock` to avoid deadlocks [3](https://www.machinet.net/tutorial-eng/common-pitfalls-with-mutex-in-cpp-multithreading).

2. **Lock Contention**:
   - **Description**: Happens when multiple threads frequently attempt to acquire the same mutex, leading to performance degradation.
   - **Example**: High contention on a single mutex protecting a shared resource.
   - **Avoidance**: Minimize the critical section and consider using finer-grained locking or lock-free data structures [3](https://www.machinet.net/tutorial-eng/common-pitfalls-with-mutex-in-cpp-multithreading).

3. **Priority Inversion**:
   - **Description**: Occurs when a higher-priority thread is waiting for a mutex held by a lower-priority thread, causing priority inversion.
   - **Example**: A low-priority thread holding a mutex needed by a high-priority thread.
   - **Avoidance**: Use priority inheritance protocols or design the system to minimize priority inversion [3](https://www.machinet.net/tutorial-eng/common-pitfalls-with-mutex-in-cpp-multithreading).

4. **Incorrect Usage**:
   - **Description**: Forgetting to unlock a mutex, unlocking a mutex from the wrong thread, or locking a mutex unnecessarily.
   - **Example**: Forgetting to unlock a mutex in all code paths, leading to deadlocks.
   - **Avoidance**: Use RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) with `std::lock_guard` or `std::unique_lock` to ensure mutexes are properly managed [4](https://thelinuxcode.com/cpp-std-mutex/).

5. **Performance Overhead**:
   - **Description**: Mutexes introduce overhead due to context switching and locking mechanisms.
   - **Example**: Excessive use of mutexes in performance-critical code paths.
   - **Avoidance**: Use `std::atomic` for simple atomic operations and minimize the use of mutexes where possible [5](https://acodersjourney.com/top-20-cplusplus-multithreading-mistakes/).

By understanding these pitfalls and choosing the appropriate synchronization primitive for your specific use case, you can write more efficient and robust concurrent programs.

Latches and barriers are synchronization primitives introduced in C++20 to help coordinate the execution of multiple threads. They provide mechanisms for threads to wait until certain conditions are met, making it easier to manage complex parallel tasks.

### Latches (`std::latch`)

A latch is a simple synchronization primitive that acts as a countdown mechanism. It allows threads to wait until a specified number of operations have been completed. Once the counter reaches zero, all waiting threads are released.

**Key Characteristics**:
- **Single-use**: Once the counter reaches zero, the latch cannot be reused.
- **Countdown**: The counter is initialized to a specific value and decremented by threads until it reaches zero.
- **Blocking**: Threads can block on the latch until the counter is zero.

**Example**:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <latch>

std::latch latch(3); // Initialize latch with a counter of 3

void task(int id) {
    std::cout << "Task " << id << " started.\n";
    latch.count_down(); // Decrement the counter
    latch.wait(); // Wait until the counter is zero
    std::cout << "Task " << id << " completed.\n";
}

int main() {
    std::thread t1(task, 1);
    std::thread t2(task, 2);
    std::thread t3(task, 3);

    t1.join();
    t2.join();
    t3.join();

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the latch is initialized with a counter of 3. Each task decrements the counter and waits until all tasks have completed.

### Barriers (`std::barrier`)

A barrier is a reusable synchronization primitive that allows a group of threads to wait until all threads in the group have reached a certain point. Once all threads have arrived, they are released simultaneously, and the barrier can be reused.

**Key Characteristics**:
- **Reusable**: Unlike latches, barriers can be reused multiple times.
- **Thread Coordination**: Blocks a group of threads until all threads have reached the barrier.
- **Completion Function**: Optionally, a completion function can be executed when all threads reach the barrier.

**Example**:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <barrier>

std::barrier barrier(3,  {
    std::cout << "All tasks have reached the barrier.\n";
});

void task(int id) {
    std::cout << "Task " << id << " started.\n";
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(100 * id)); // Simulate work
    barrier.arrive_and_wait(); // Wait at the barrier
    std::cout << "Task " << id << " completed.\n";
}

int main() {
    std::thread t1(task, 1);
    std::thread t2(task, 2);
    std::thread t3(task, 3);

    t1.join();
    t2.join();
    t3.join();

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the barrier is initialized with a count of 3 and a completion function that prints a message when all tasks reach the barrier. Each task waits at the barrier until all tasks have arrived.

### Summary

- **Latches**: Single-use countdown mechanism for synchronizing threads.
- **Barriers**: Reusable synchronization mechanism for coordinating a group of threads.

These primitives simplify thread synchronization and improve performance by often using lock-free mechanisms internally [1](https://www.modernescpp.com/index.php/latches-and-barriers/) [2](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/latch) [3](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/barrier).
